                Macaw is a company that functions mainly within Europe. Their employees are mainly from the Netherlands, Germany and Lithuania. T
                hey pride themselves in the quality that they deliver. Macaw goes the extra mile to satisfy their costumers, which is why they have built
                such a good name for themselves. They strive to make their company a comfortable place to work too. Macaw cares a lot about their employees,
                which is why their ‘offices’ are often described as ‘living rooms’. A few of their IT roles include Data Engineer, Business Consultant Data
                and Analytics, Client Consultant, Creative Consultant and Security consultant.
                <br>
                <br>
                Macaw always uses the latest technology that’s available, even if it’s not yet available to the public on the market.
                This gives them an edge over their competition. This draws many new clients to them, since there are not many companies that
                can say the same thing.

                <br>
                <br>
                Treyarch is one of the biggest game development studios out there right now. They are best known for their incredibly
                popular ‘Call of Duty: Black Ops’ series. They’ve got a big team with people that specialize in different areas of game development.
                Treyarch has been around since 1996, so over the years, they’ve obtained a huge amount of experience. Not only that, but most employees are
                gamers themselves, so they look at the game from a developer as well as a player aspect.
                <br>
                <br>
                There is much more to creating a game than writing the code for said game. That’s why Treyarch has entire departments
                dedicated to things like Design, Engineering and Business and Marketing. Some of their vacancies are Principal Graphics Engineer,
                Producer, Weapons Artist, Character Artist and Associate Level Designer.
