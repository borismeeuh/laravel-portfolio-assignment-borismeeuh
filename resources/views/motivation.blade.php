<h2>Theory</h2>

In order to pass this HBO ICT course, you need motivation. You need something that drives you to keep up the work, hand in assignments on time etc. In this
paragraph, i'll explain what drives me to succesfully complete this course and discuss several different types of motivation.
<br>
First of all, what does motivation mean? The Cambridge Dictionary defines it as follows: Enthusiasm for doing something. That is in my opinion
a clear, straight forward way the explain the meaning of 'motivation'. Motivation is the reason or motive as to why you are doing something.
<br>
There are several important types of motivation that make me want to complete this course. Firstly, there is competence motivation. I want to keep getting
better at coding for example. In addition, I want to prove to myself that I able to succesfully complete an HBO course. Secondly, I want to be able to
sustain myself and my possible family later on in life. This means, that I'll have to get a good job to earn a good living. In order to obtain such a job, i'll
have to get a diploma. Thirdly, there is the financial motivation. There are opportunities in the IT field, that there may as well be infinite. There are plenty
of job opportunities and each job has a plethora of ways to climb the social ladder and make more money.
<br>
<br>
Most people divide motivation in two main types:

<ul style="list-style: circle;">
    <li>Intrinsic motivation</li>
    <li>Extrinsic motivation</li>
</ul>

<br>
These two main types of motivation more or less speak for them selves. Intrinsic motivation is anything that motivates you as an individual. It is
therefore based on internal award. That means that the results of your achievements, reached through intrinsic motivation, are not always visible to other people.
Examples include getting over internal fears and internal desires. Extrinsic motivation, like the name implies, are the things that motivate you based on external
rewards like money or praise.
<br>
There are other sub-categories of motivation too. These include, but are not limited to:

<ul style="list-style: circle;">
    <li>Achievement motivation - Here, the achievement is the primairy goal, not the reward</li>
    <li>Competence motivation - This type of motivation could mean someone wants to develop a certain skill really well.</li>
    <li>Power motivation - Here, people are motivated by the will to influence other people.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>TED talk</h2>

According to Dan Pink, motivation revolves around three things: autonomy, mastery and purpose. Autonomy  means the urge to direct your own life.
Mastery means the desire to get better and better at something. Purpose means the yearning to what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.
<br>
<br>
According to Dan Pink, autonomy motivates people way more than money. Accoriding to Dan Pink, people who have autonomy
over their time, focus and ideas are more productive than people who are forced to work at something by their supervisors. When they are not
told to work at something, they can work on whatever they want in both a creative and productive manner.


<h2>Performance motivation</h2>

<div class="container5">

    The results of the test were a mixed bag to me. The intrinsically
    motivated part was as expected. If I like to do certain for school
    or work for example, even if it's aditional, I'll do said thing.
    A good example for school would be the fact that I did both MUN and
    an internship. You had to do at least one of the two. Doing both was
    not required but I ended up doing both MUN and an intership anyway.
    <br>
    <br>
    The 40% you're obviously lying' was quite a surprise to me. I'm not
    exactly sure what they mean by that. I filled in the test as honestly
    as possible, so Profile B's result was pretty confusing to me.
    <br>
    <br>
    The other results were not too surprising to me. Maybe Profile C could
    be a little bit higher. Extrinsic motivation is certainly important,
    especially today. Housing, education, daily food and drinks are
    really expensive these days, so a good salary is without a doubt
    attractive. Profile D was basically what I expected. The result was
    0% 'not motivated' and I would say that that is true. So far I'm really
    enjoying the study which is a big motivation in and of itself.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Test results:</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Are you Intrinsically or Extrinsically Motivated?
        <i><u>For 50% you are: You are primarily intrinsically motivated.</u></i>You are able to enjoy yourself in almost any activity, because you tend to engage in an activity for its own sake. You find what you do to be enjoyable, and that is enough of a reason for you to do anything.
        74% of 4351 quiz participants had this profile! Profile A
        <br>
        <br>
        You could also get this result:
        <i><u> 40% you are: You are obviously lying.</u></i>You need to take a long, hard look at yourself. Profile B
        <br>
        <br>
        Or even this one:
        <i><u>For 10% you are: You are primarily extrinsically motivated.</u></i> You prefer to let outside factors dictate your actions. You tend to focus more on the
        finish line instead of the race. It usually takes an external incentive
        like money or grades to get you going. This can include negative motivation such as losing money or threats. This kind of attitude can really
        undermine your creative side. You might want to rethink your motives a little, you may find that some of your best work comes from being self-motivated. Profile C
        <br>
        <br>
        Or even this one:
        <i><u>For 0% you are: You are not motivated.</u></i> At all. Where did you even find the incentive to take this quiz? Profile D

<h2>Career anchors</h2>

For me personally, the 'work-life balance' is probably the most important thing. I think it's very important to have a life besides work. This
includes things like sports, hobbies and spending time with friends and family. A good work-life balance also allows you to take better care of
yourself. You could, for example, spend more time preparing healthy food and make sure you stay healthy mentally and physically.
<br>
<br>
The second most important for me, is the 'doing your very best' anchor. If you try your best, other people are inevitably going to notice. This
means that they will often be more than willing  to help you out if you're struggling with something. That is because they see that you care and
take your job seriously. Your boss will also appreciate a hard working employee. This could also mean that you're more likely to earn yourself a
raise. From my own experience, I have noticed, people don't really mind if you make mistakes, as long as you are genuinly trying your best.
<br>
<br>
The least important anchor to me, is the anchor about status. Generally speaking I'm not too worried about what most people think about me. Therefore
I don't really care if they think highly of my future job or not.
