        My name is Boris Kamstra. I'm nineteen years old. I'm from Stellendam, a tiny village about an hour north from Middelburg.

        In high school, I attended an Informatica class. One of the things we had to do was to build a basic website. My experience with
        programming languages is fairly limited, but I really liked what we had to do. That's the main reason I ended up choosing an ICT
        course. I chose HZ because I really like Middelburg. It's not too small, but not too big and crowded either. In my Informatica class,
        I got to experience the very basics of programming and I really enjoyed it. That is the primary reason
        why I believe the ICT course suits me well.

        Some of my favourite places in Stellendam include:

        <li>Skatepark</li>
        <li>Haringvliet lake</li>
        <li>Het Wapen van Stellendam</li>
    </ul>
